At medium time scales (say, within a scene), one can use appearance features such as hair and clothing to group tracks across shot boundaries. However, at longer timescales (say, across episodes), one can no longer use clothing as a cue. This suggests that one needs to carefully encode representations of appearance, depending on the timescale at which one intends to match.", "We assemble our final dataset by classifying groups of tracks in a", "nearest-neighbors framework.

Six working group topics were identified based on the scholarship\u00a0and interests of the invited participants. The groups were then tasked to meet, discuss, and debate their respective topics, the results of which appear as the first six chapters of this\u00a0report. The six CGVW chapter topics are:", "Each chapter addresses a common set of concerns including current research findings,\u00a0emerging research problems of high consequence, future research infrastructure needs, and\u00a0broader impacts arising from research investments in each of the six topic areas. Contributors to these chapters represent a diverse set of scholars and disciplines that might\u00a0not otherwise be drawn together. No effort was directed to integrating the results presented\u00a0across the chapters, so each chapter can be read and reviewed standalone, though better if\u00a0reviewed comparatively across chapters.", "The report also identifies overall observations that advocate investment in future CGVW research.\u00a0Their intent is to be bold and stimulating. These observations are summarized as follows.", "CGVWs as new media and technologies of practice have the potential to pervade most, if not all,\u00a0sectors of scientific research, technology development, educational and cultural practices in\u00a0industry, academia, and government. CGVWs are not a \u201ckiller app,\u201d but instead CGVWs are more\u00a0likely the next Web: a new layer of systems and applications that can cross social, organizational,\u00a0institutional and technological boundaries, just like the World-Wide Web has done over the past\u00a015 or so years.", "CGVWs are not about mere \u201cgamification\u201d by which we mean turning existing socio-technical \u00a0systems into those where users simply earn virtual badges, points, or prizes for accomplished \u00a0game play. Instead, CGVWs are rich socio-technical systems that can facilitate creativity, new \u00a0cultural practices, new educational opportunities, and new ways and means for stimulating research and higher education in the sciences, health, and related disciplines.", "CGVWs are embracing the next-generation workforce of those who will seek to work in the \u00a0various MACH, SHEED, ABS, and advanced IT disciplines, industries or government agencies. \u00a0Market research figures suggest that at least one billion people world-wide are now playing and \u00a0interacting through CGVWs. Investments in STEM education do not yet address this, nor do \u00a0current R&D investments across government agencies identify this situation.", "The U.S. currently leads the global development of new CGVW-centered products and services.\u00a0Such socio-economic condition and market leadership can be accelerated through investment in a new CGVW research agenda, such as that identified in this report. New firms and highly skilled \u00a0jobs will emerge through such investments into CGVW research, as can new markets.", "Future research in CGVWs can be targeted to different research agencies and research \u00a0programs that can maximize interests through targeted investments. Games for health care \u00a0represents one such application domain for focused CGVW research. Games for health may be \u00a0able to provide a new way and means for facilitating self-managed chronic care ailments that can \u00a0be personally rewarding as well as transformative\u2014not in the sense of curing the ailment, but in the sense of making the ailment amenable to personal activity and self-care more manageable.\nResearch in CGVWs overlaps most areas of current interest that advance the overall science \u00a0research agenda for networked information technology (NITRD 2012). Massively multi-user CGVWs represent new venues for communication and social interaction that generate big data about social, behavioral, cultural, and technological practice, all data that characterize societal processes. New research challenge problems like reanimating the visible human can generate new scientific knowledge from domains that link or converge across nanotechnology, biology, information technology, and cognitive science (NBIC) disciplines.", "The industries currently vested in CGVWs as entertainment media are not leading the way in pushing the R&D horizons identified in this report. Without coordination of research investment, CGVW technology will emerge as disjoint, islands of automation that will become evermore complex and costly to integrate for mutual benefit.", "This report identified six related areas that would benefit from strategic or programmatic R&D investments. The national NITRD (2012) agenda and grand challenge problem domains are both amenable to be favorably advanced through investment in CGVW research. In particular, the NITRD Program and this report put forward recommendations for a planning and coordination support request whose structure provides a model for what, where, how, when, and why to invest in to strategically stimulate CGVW research (NITRD 2012, pp. 19-20): Co-funding testbeds, infrastructures, and advanced tools/instrumentation for experimentation with new CGVW technologies; Workshops that mobilize and bring together researchers, program managers, and socio-economic leaders; Collaborative deployment of new CGVW system infrastructures, tools, repositories/archives across R&D programs; Interagency cooperation to focus research investment that identify and provide solutions to challenges in mission-oriented SHEED programs; Technical standards for interoperable, scalable, secure, and scalable CGVW systems and infrastructures; Testbeds that enable the joint R&D experimentation, crowdsourcing, and decentralized study of CGVWs; and a Science and Technology Steering Council.", "Overall, CGVWs are an engine of innovation: one that can stimulate the production of new knowledge and practice in multiple scientific, creative, cultural, educational and IT-centered disciplines, industries, and government agencies. CGVWs are emerging as socio-technical ecosystems for addressing problems in areas such as education, socio-economic development, health care, and scientific research. This statement is based not on speculation, but on diverse R&D results, projects, and expertise cited in this report and beyond (see Steinkuehler Squire 2011). CGVWs represent transformative technologies and socio-economic practices whose time is coming, and whose opportunity to strategically invest is near at hand. If the purpose of careful and cautious investment of limited public funds is to realize the greatest benefits to many diverse public and private interests, then CGVW merits serious attention, consideration, and commitment of resources that can fuel this engine of innovation. Such engines of growth and prosperity are uncommon and often elusive. Keep this new engine of innovation well fueled and fund its improvement.\nReferences", "\u00a0"], "Title": ["The Future of Research in Computer Games and Virtual Worlds \u2013 Center for Computer Games & Virtual Worlds", "The Future of Research in Computer Games and Virtual Worlds", "Post navigation", "Blogroll", "Archives"], "Span": ["", "Author  ", "Author  ", "Author ", "Posted on ", "Posted on ", "Categories ", "Categories ", "Tags , , ", "Tags ", ""], "Others": [], "url": "cgvw.ics.uci.edu/the-future-of-research-in-computer-games-and-virtual-worlds"}, "0/113": {"Link_Name": ["David Eppstein", "Tech. report CUCS-440-89", "Columbia Univ., Computer Science Dept.", "1989", "D.

This is a specific instance of a situation that comes up\nfrequently, not just in the real world but also in computer systems.  Computer\nnetworks, in particular, consist in some sense of client requests (like\nyour browser requesting a web page or your computer sending a document to\na shared printer) and servers satisfying them.  When the server can't\nsatisfy each request immediately, the waiting requests are typically queued\nup.  Determining the overall performance of a network (how long do requests\nhave to wait, how many can be satisfied per minute) is a crucial task, since\ndecisions about the size and number of servers and the necessary bandwidth\ndepend on that analysis (and on a more practical level, if your web site\nmakes visitors wait annoyingly and your competitor's site serves them\nquickly, your competitor will receive more traffic, be more successful,\nand have a better chance of being bought out for $100 million by AOL).", "\nThis project analyzes the performance of a\nqueueing system experimentally, by simulating it.

Our view is that the net neutrality issue is the result of a fragmented communications policy unable to deal with technology convergence. We develop a net neutrality policy based on the layered structure of the Internet that gracefully accommodates convergence. Our framework distinguishes between discrimination in high barrier-to-entry network infrastructure and in low barrier-to-entry applications. The policy prohibits use of Internet infrastructure to produce an uneven playing field in Internet applications. In this manner, the policy restricts an Internet service provider's ability to discriminate in a manner that extracts oligopoly rents, while simultaneously ensuring that ISPs can use desirable forms of network management. We illustrate how this net neutrality policy can draw upon current communications law through draft statute language. We believe this approach is well grounded in both technology and policy, and that it illustrates a middle ground that may even be somewhat agreeable to the opposing forces on this issue.", "Our proposed  layered approach to defining nondiscrimination rules that removes the need to define either \u201cmanaged services\u201d or what constitutes the \u201cInternet portion\u201d of a provider's offerings. We propose that any QoS mechanisms that an ISP implements in network infrastructure layers should be available to application providers without unreasonable discrimination. Requiring such an open interface can ensure that ISPs are prohibited from refusing to provide enabling Internet infrastructure services to competing application providers in order to differentiate the ISP's own application offerings, prohibited from providing Internet infrastructure services to competing application providers at inflated prices in order to favor the ISP's own application offerings, and prohibited from making exclusive deals to provide enabling Internet infrastructure services to certain application providers. It can also ensure that ISPs have the right to apply network management mechanisms that do not threaten a level playing field, and to make arrangements with consumers, application providers, and peering ISPs for Internet infrastructure services in a manner that does not conflict with the above goals.\n", "This type of layered approach, requiring an open interface, is a more streamlined and more effective solution that carving out a set of managed services. There is no need to define what constitutes the \u201cInternet portion\u201d of a provider's offerings. There is also no need to define what constitutes \u201cmanaged services\u201d, as the open interface requires access to lower layer QoS mechanisms that enables real-time applications, rather than carving out real-time applications as an exception. The open interface thus encourages competition in managed services, rather than inhibiting such competition.", "This paper is intended for people with a background in communications policy:", ", International Journal of Communication, Special Section on Net Neutrality, vol. 1, 2007.", "This paper is intended for people with a technical background in networking:", ", ACM Transactions on Internet Technology, vol. 9 no. 2, May 2009, pp. 5:1-5:28.", "\u00a0", "Our Research on Reasonable Traffic Management", "As part of the wider debate over net neutrality, traffic management practices of Internet Service Providers have become an issue of public concern. The Federal Communications Commission has asked for public input on whether deep packet inspection and other traffic management practices are reasonable forms of network management. Little attention has been paid to this issue within the academic networking community, and most Internet policy researchers have recommended a case-by-case analysis. ", "In contrast, in these papers we propose a framework for the classification of traffic management practices as reasonable or unreasonable. To build the framework, we focus both on the technical aspects of traffic management techniques and on the goals and practices of an ISP that uses these techniques. The framework classifies traffic management practices as reasonable or unreasonable on the basis of the technique used and on the basis of how and when the techniques are applied. We suggest that whether a traffic management practice is reasonable largely rests on the answers to four questions regarding the techniques and practices used. We consider examples of how these techniques are used by ISPs, and how the answers to these four questions collectively affeect the degree to which a traffic management practice is reasonable. Based on these questions, we propose a framework that classifies techniques as unreasonable if they are unreasonably anti-competitive, cause undue harm to consumers, or unreasonably impair free speech.", "We propose that traffic management practices are reasonable if they are implemented at endpoints, are chosen by the user, are based on reasonable application provider payment, or involve providing QoS to traffic chosen by the user. We propose that traffic management practices implemented in transit nodes without user choice are unreasonable if they block applications, assign QoS based on source, destination or service provider, or assign QoS based on unreasonable application provider payment. We suggest that QoS based on the application can be more effectively implemented by allowing the user to determine the priority of his/her applications, and we suggest that any charges for QoS can be most effectively implemented by integrating them into subscriber contracts and into the Service Level Agreements between ISPs, rather than by charging application providers that are not subscribers.

Although wireless networks require stronger traffic management, we find these differences are only at and below the network layer, and hence wireless broadband access providers can effectively control congestion without restricting a user\u2019s right to run the applications of their choice.", "We are also concerned with which wireless applications or services should be covered by a net neutrality requirement, and whether this requires the definition of managed services.
